# Twitter Sentiment Analysis<br>
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets using machine learning models. The goal is to classify the sentiments of tweets into categories such as Positive, Negative, Neutral, and Irrelevant.<br>

## Project Overview<br> 
**The project involves the following steps:**<br>

-Data Collection<br>
-Data Preprocessing<br>
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
-Model Building and Training<br>
-Model Evaluation<br>
-Predictions and Insights<br>

## Data Collection: <br>
Data is collected from Twitter and loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.<br>

## Data Preprocessing<br>
Data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting text data into a format suitable for model training.<br>

## Model Building and Training<br>
Machine learning models are built and trained on the dataset to predict the sentiment of tweets. Models used include logistic regression, decision trees.<bR>

## Model Evaluation<br>
Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model is selected for making predictions.<br>

## Predictions and Insights<Br>
The final model is used to predict the sentiment of new tweets. Insights and trends in the data are discussed based on the predictions.<br>
